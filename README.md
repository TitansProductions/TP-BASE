3. Scoreboard - Fully functionable, displaying job counts. There is also feature for administrators / moderators when clicking a steam name of a player, to display the clicked player personal profile, including their inventory.

4. Tickets - Allow your players to create tickets when having a problem in game, there is also a feature for administrators / moderators to view all the available tickets (reports), teleport to online players or closing a ticket by setting it as solved in order to not be displayed anymore (Of course an option for webhooking & sql database saving).

5. Discord Downbar Icon - When a player clicks the discord icon, it directly opens a browser in order to join your discord server.
