What does this Base UI provides me?

1. Inventory (Using Shortcuts and Tooltip Hover Text for items or weapons displaying any kind of description / or not).

2. Personal Player Profile - Displaying Steam Name, Username, Character Statistics such as cash, bank account and black money, including a custom avatar image.

3. Scoreboard - Fully functionable, displaying job counts. There is also feature for administrators / moderators when clicking a steam name of a player, to display the clicked player personal profile, including their inventory.

4. Tickets - Allow your players to create tickets when having a problem in game, there is also a feature for administrators / moderators to view all the available tickets (reports), teleport to online players or closing a ticket by setting it as solved in order to not be displayed anymore (Of course an option for webhooking & sql database saving).

5. Discord Downbar Icon - When a player clicks the discord icon, it directly opens a browser in order to join your discord server.

6. Feedback Downbar Icon - When a player clicks the feedback (lamp) icon, he / she will be able to create a feedback (suggestion) for the server (Of course an option for webhooking & sql database saving). The url can be changed where config.js file is located.

8. We also provide you a very decent and workable trunk system for storing items, weapons, money and blackmoney, including a trunk weight system.
