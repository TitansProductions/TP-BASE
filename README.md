    Tickets - Allow your players to create tickets when having a problem in game, there is also a feature for administrators / moderators to view all the available tickets (reports), teleport to online players or closing a ticket by setting it as solved in order to not be displayed anymore (Of course an option for webhooking & sql database saving).

    Discord Downbar Icon - When a player clicks the discord icon, it directly opens a browser in order to join your discord server.

    Feedback Downbar Icon - When a player clicks the feedback (lamp) icon, he / she will be able to create a feedback (suggestion) for the server (Of course an option for webhooking & sql database saving). The url can be changed where config.js file is located.
